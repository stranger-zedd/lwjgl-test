LWJGL Test
==========

Simple test project to try out LWJGL

To run:
 * Download [LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org/download.php)
 * Extract it to somewhere
 * Open project in eclipse, update jar references to point to your version of LWJGL
 * Update reference to native library (expand the 'lwjgl' jar and change the 'native reference' path)
 * Code should now compile and run.

Thoughts:
 * The library is very lightweight, also very mature
 * Not so sure about using what equates to bare-metal OpenGL calls to render stuff
